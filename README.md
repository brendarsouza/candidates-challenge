# Candidates Challenge

This project is a portal to add job candidates. It consists of a backend made with NestJS and Node.js, and a frontend in Angular 19. Both have unit tests using Jest.

## Installation

### Backend

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BrendaReSouza/candidates-challenge
    cd candidates-challenge/backend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the environment variables as needed.

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## How to Run

### Backend

1. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

2. The backend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:4200`.

## Functionality

The portal allows adding job candidates through a form on the frontend. The form has the following fields:

- First Name (text input)
- Last Name (text input)
- XLSX File (upload)

The XLSX file must contain three columns:
1. Availability (Yes or No)
2. Years of Experience (number)
3. Seniority (Junior or Senior)

The file must contain at least one filled row.

When uploading the file and submitting the form, a request will be sent to the backend. The backend will interpret the form data and return a JSON with all the information, both the input data and the data from the file.

The frontend will display the data in a table below the form. We are using localStorage as a temporary database to visualize the inserted data. The process can be repeated, and with each data and file insertion, new rows will be added to the table with the new candidates.

## Unit Tests

### Backend

To run the backend unit tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

### Frontend

```
